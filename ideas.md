- [] Using items - potions are not allowed during combat, they should be allowed.. 

- [] Enemies does not have loot, they should have items and gold depending on their type, currently all enemies defeated shows no loot in loot phase. Gained experience is not shown in loot phase, which it should be shown.

- [] In inventory and equipment modal, it is not allowed to wear shields in off hands, which is a bug. 

- [] Rings, necklaces and crowns(not kings or queens crown but jeweleries) are not available in shop and does not have section in the shop and inventory , and cannot be equipped. Make it happen.

- [] Magic spells feature: should exist as learnable via npcs and books. There should be section for magic spells modal.

- [] Sleeping and resting should recover stamina health and magicka. 

- [] Leveling up should prompt a new level up modal, asking player/user to select one stat to increase by 10 (health magicka or stamina) hero page. Leveling up also should give one perk point to player/characters available to use on perks. This should also have its own ui and modal on hero tab. This feature should be dynamic and should be confirmed by player and then applied.

- [] Eating food should recover health as well.

- [] Passed time in combat module should be reflected to game time as it does in adventure tab (adventure tab is a different than combat module)
